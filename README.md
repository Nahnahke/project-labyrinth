🏁 Goals:

In this week's project, we were tasked with building a project which allows a user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend in React and Redux and we have successfully completed what we set out to do.

The goal for this week was to use the API specified to build a frontend that gives the user control over what to do next. We focused on using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend. 

Overall, we found this project to be a great opportunity to practice the use of thunks, bring together different parts of React and working with fetching and posting to an API. We are very pleased with the outcome and looking forward to using the skills and knowledge we gained from this project in future endeavors.

Must-have requirements:

✅ Build a responsive page.

✅ Use Redux to store the current state of the game.

✅ Focus on the UX design and handle response delay.

✅ Use thunks to wrap the API calls.
